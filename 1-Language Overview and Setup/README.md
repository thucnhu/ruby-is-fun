# Language Overview and Setup

## History

<ol>
  <li>The language we will be learning is Ruby</li>
  <li>Ruby was developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro Matsumoto in Japan, who was an expert in many programming languages at the time, including Perl, Eiffel, Smalltalk, Lisp, and Ada. Ruby, therefore, was inspired by these languages and designed with the idea of combining all their best elements. Its design also emphasizes programming productivity and simplicity.</li>
  <li>Ruby is primarily used for creating web applications. It also serves many other purposes such as building static websites, data processing services, DevOps, web scrapling and crawling.</li>
</ol>
